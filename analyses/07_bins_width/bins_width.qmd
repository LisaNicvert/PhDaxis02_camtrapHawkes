This code infers the parameters of a Hawkes process on the same data as in folder `05_example_real_data` but with different bins widths.

## Load libraries

```{r, message = FALSE, output = FALSE}
# Load functions from main folder
library(camtrapHawkes)

packages <- c("here", "lubridate", "UnitEvents",
              "ggplot2", "patchwork", "dplyr")
base::lapply(packages, require)
here::i_am("analyses/07_bins_width/bins_width.qmd")
```

## Parameters

```{r params}
# --- Inference parameters
# Bins width
smaller <- c(1, 3, 5)
bigger <- c(7, 9, 11)
close <- c(5.5, 5.75, 6.25, 6.5)
dhours_vec <- c(smaller, bigger, close)

ndays <- 1.5
gamma <- 0.5
scale <- 10e7
estimator <- "BVL"

# --- Figures
figures_path <- here("figures/07_bins_width")
```

## Read data

```{r read}
dat <- read.csv(here("outputs/05_example_real_data/cleaned_data.csv"))

# Format datetimes
fmt <- "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
dat$datetime <- as.POSIXct(dat$datetime, format = fmt)
dat$datetime <- force_tz(dat$datetime, tz = "Etc/GMT-2")

```

## Rename species

```{r}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(snapshotName = ifelse(snapshotName == "wildebeestblue", 
                               "wildebeest", snapshotName)) %>%
  mutate(snapshotName = ifelse(snapshotName == "zebraburchells", 
                               "zebra", snapshotName))
```

## Infer several models

```{r infer, results='hide'}
# --- get alphabetical species order 
spp_names <- sort(unique(dat$snapshotName))

modlist <- vector("list", 
                  length(dhours_vec))
names(modlist) <- dhours_vec

for (i in 1:length(dhours_vec)) {
  # --- Get k and delta
  delta <- dhours_vec[i]/24 # delta in days
  k <- ceiling(ndays/delta) # k from delta and dmax
  
  # --- Infer
  inf <- infer(dat, 
               k = k, delta = delta,
               gamma = gamma, scale = scale)
  # If the error:
  # Erreur dans NeuroCorr_SetParallel(threads) : 
  #   impossible de trouver la fonction "NeuroCorr_SetParallel"
  # appears, restart R, re-load packages and re-run
  
  # --- Format inferred model
  u_inf <- unpack_inf(inf, 
                      species_names = spp_names, 
                      k = k, delta = delta)
  
  
  df_ue <- ue_model_to_df(u_inf[[estimator]])
  
  modlist[[i]] <- df_ue
}
```

## Plot inferred interactions and rates

Now let's plot the graphs:

```{r interactions}
# --- Initialize glist
glist_inter <- vector("list", length(modlist))
names(glist_inter) <- names(modlist)

for (i in 1:length(modlist)) {
  # --- Plot
  mod <- modlist[[i]]
  bin <- names(modlist)[i]
  
  g <- plot_interactions(mod,
                         scale = "hours", 
                         textsize = 12,
                         timestep = floor((max(mod$time)*24)/3),
                         ystep = 0.2,
                         h = 0,
                         separate_self = TRUE,
                         title = paste("Bin width:",
                                   bin,
                                   ifelse(bin == "1",
                                          "hour", "hours")))
  
  glist_inter[[i]] <- wrap_elements(g)
}
```

```{r background_rates}
# --- Initialize glist_bg
glist_bg <- vector("list", length(modlist))
names(glist_bg) <- names(modlist)

for (i in 1:length(modlist)) {
  # --- Plot
  mod <- modlist[[i]]
  bin <- names(modlist)[i]
  
  g <- plot_background_rate(ue_df = mod,
                     textsize = 12,
                     write_label = TRUE,
                     title = paste("Bin width:",
                                   bin,
                                   ifelse(bin == "1",
                                          "hour", "hours")))
  
  glist_bg[[i]] <- wrap_elements(g)

}
```

## Comparison of different bins widths

Here are the parameters inferred with 6 hours bins in `05_example_real_data`:

![Original interactions](../../figures/05_example_real_data/interactions.jpeg)

![Original background rates](../../figures/05_example_real_data/background_rates.jpeg)

Below are the values for bins much smaller than the original bin width (6 hours):

```{r, fig.width=18, fig.height=12}
smaller_names <- as.character(smaller)
wrap_plots(c(glist_inter[smaller_names],
             glist_bg[smaller_names]), 
           nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE,
           heights = c(8, 3))

# Export plot
ggsave(file.path(figures_path, "smaller_bins.jpeg"),
       bg = "white",
       width = 22, height = 13,
       dpi = 300)
```

The inferred interactions for the 3 tested bin widths above are pretty similar. Moreover, all nonzero interactions are the same as in the 6-hours bins version. However, some interactions present in the 6-hours bins version are missed, possibly due to lower power. The inferred background rates have similar numerical values than those inferred with 6 hours bins, and they are pretty stable except for impala. However, their relative strength is the same.

Below are the values for bins bigger than 6 hours:

```{r, fig.width=18, fig.height=12}
bigger_names <- as.character(bigger)
wrap_plots(c(glist_inter[bigger_names],
             glist_bg[bigger_names]), 
           nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE,
           heights = c(8, 3))

# Export plot
ggsave(file.path(figures_path, "bigger_bins.jpeg"),
       bg = "white",
       width = 22, height = 13,
       dpi = 300)
```

Again, the inferred interactions above are pretty similar for the different bin widths. And all nonzero interactions are the same as in the 6-hours bins version, except an attraction of impala by lion that appears after 36 hours with 7 and 11 hours bins. No interactions that appeared in the 6 hours inference are missed. The inferred background rates are similar to those inferred with 6 hours bins.

Below are the values for bins close to 6 hours:

```{r, fig.width=24, fig.height=12}
close_names <- as.character(close)
wrap_plots(c(glist_inter[close_names],
             glist_bg[close_names]), 
           nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE,
           heights = c(8, 3))
# Export plot
ggsave(file.path(figures_path, "close_bins.jpeg"),
       bg = "white",
       width = 22, height = 13,
       dpi = 300)
```

Again the interactions are similar to those of the 6 hours bins. We can notice that an attraction appears between lion and impala between 30 and 36 hours of delay with impala attracted by lion, which is not the case in the 6 hours bins case. This might be due to the fact that this attraction is at the edge of the 36 hours of maximal delay imposed in the original setting, whereas here the time bins extend further due to the function support extending after 36 hours (this was necessary because of the discretized bins). The inferred background rates are similar to those inferred with 6 hours bins.
